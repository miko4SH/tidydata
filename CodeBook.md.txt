Dataset Overview
This dataset contains accelerometer and gyroscope data collected from 30 subjects performing six activities using a Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. The goal is to clean and summarize the data by calculating the mean and standard deviation of the measurements for each subject and activity.

Variables
>>>>Subject: Identifier for each subject (1–30).

>>>>Activity: The activity being performed (e.g., WALKING, SITTING).

>>>>Sensor Measurements: 561 features representing mean and standard deviation of accelerometer and gyroscope data (e.g.,      tBodyAcc-mean-X, tBodyGyro-std-Y).

Key Features:
	>tBodyAcc: Body acceleration (mean and std).

	>tGravityAcc: Gravity acceleration (mean and std).

	>tBodyGyro: Body angular velocity (mean and std).

	>fBodyAcc: Fourier transformed body acceleration (mean and std).

	>fBodyGyro: Fourier transformed body angular velocity (mean and std).

Data Transformations
	>Merged the training and test datasets.

	>Filtered features to include only mean and standard deviation measurements.

	>Replaced activity IDs with descriptive activity names.

	>Calculated the average for each variable by subject and activity to create the final tidy dataset.
Units
	>Acceleration: meters per second squared (m/s²)

	>Angular Velocity: radians per second (rad/s)
